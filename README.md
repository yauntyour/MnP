# MnP ——A high speed web AS/SY service

We use the **libevent** to making our **MnP**. That's so good——because the **libevent** it's one has industrial stability socket library (though it occupies a very big memory,but it also has a very high speed).

In this time,this project didn't done. But my idea is this project has a industrial stability the same as **libevent**, and it has a more portability. So it can has a relatively compact memory size and a high runing speed.

Above it's my project's summary in initial stage.
